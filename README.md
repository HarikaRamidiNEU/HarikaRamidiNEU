### Hey... 👋 I'm Harika! 

- 👩‍🎓 I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University's College of Engineering in Boston.

- 👩‍💻 My interests lie in Fullstack Engineering, UI Development, Backend Development, and DevOps.

- 💼 Prior to beginning my studies at Northeastern, I spent three years working as a Software Engineer at Insideview Technologies Inc. During this time, I contributed to various stages of the software development lifecycle, including leading the development of complex features from inception to deployment. I started my journey as a Software Test Engineer and progressed to become a Full Stack Developer.

- 💼 Before joining Insideview Technologies, I spent two years working as a Software Development Engineer in Test at Host Analytics. This opportunity followed an eight-month internship at the same company. While working at Host Analytics, I helped to develop a Hybrid Automation framework and engaged in several exciting Proof of Concepts using various tools and technologies.
